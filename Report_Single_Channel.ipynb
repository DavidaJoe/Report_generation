    "Overall Branded spend decreased by 15% QoQ as Programmatic and Social tactics were paused mid-May. Endemic and Search activity remained live for the full quarter.\n",
    "- Display: Spend decreased 12% QoQ as Programmatic and Non DAR Video activity was paused mid-May, driving a 34% decrease in clicks.\n",
    "    - Due to the efficiency of non-DAR Video, overall clicks decreased disproportionally to spend\n",
    "- Social: Despite activity being paused mid-May, clicks increased 10% QoQ as CPCs were lower within the Traffic campaigns.\n",
    "- Search: Clicks remained flat QoQ despite increase in spend due to higher competition and CPCs in Q2\n",
    "- Overall visits to the site declined by 11% QoQ from 1.1M to 1M, with SEM continuing to drive the highest share of traffic at 42% of total visits. Paid search visits declined QoQ by 7%.\n",
    "- Paid social continued to drive the second largest traffic volume, accounting for 25% of total. Overall volume from the channel declined QoQ by 8%. Traffic from the visit optimized buy increased 12% QoQ while reach optimized decreased 39% QoQ.\n",
    "- DAR digital video drove the third largest share of traffic this quarter at 97k visits, accounting for 9% of total. Display banners drove the fourth strongest volume. Display digital video traffic was understated but tagging was resolved on 4/28.\n",

    "Overall:\n",
    "- Even with a slight 10% budget increase QoQ due to budget shifts, search volume remained relatively steady within clicks and impressions\n",
    "- Competition within the marketplace arose QoQ, CPCs also inflated by 13% from $2.97 to $3.36\n",
    "    - Kisqali HCP re-entered the competitive space last quarter, after dropping out from the space back in Q1 for the Branded and Condition pathways. This attributed to the increased CPC last quarter\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance:\n",
    "- As the Condition and Symptom pathways shifted into an auction time bidding strategy in Q1, both pathways continue to take the lead in overall traffic\n",
    "    - Although both pathways experienced heavy competition in Q2, the Symptoms campaigns continued to present CPC efficiencies of $2.71 and a 10% growth in CTR, while the Condition campaigns displayed $2.80 in CPC efficiencies and a 17% increase in CTR\n",
    "- The Branded pathway remains the most efficient pathway with a steady SoS of 88%\n",
    "    - SoS experienced a slight dip last quarter due to increased traffic over on Bing\n",
    "\n",
    "HVA:\n",
    "- Overall, HVA performance efficiency has improved significantly QoQ going into Q2'22. CPA was lower (from $261.82 to $200.69), which was due to improvements within the automated bidding strategies along with budget allocation shifts that were made in Q1\n",
    "    - Additionaly, due to budget allocation shifts QoQ downloads significantly increased by 43%\n",
    "- The Condition pathway drove the most downloads at 3,007 while the Symptom pathway drove 763 downloads in Q2\n",
    "\n",
    "- Although visits from SEM declined by 7% QoQ from 470k to 436k, the channel remained the leading traffic driver in Q2. Site side engagement from SEM stayed relatively flat QoQ\n",
    "- The Branded and Unbranded Treatment pathways had the largest increases in visit volume QoQ at 36% and 30%, respectively. Unbranded Condition continued to drive the majority of visit volume from the channel.\n",
    "- Video start rate from SEM declined by 25% QoQ from 3.72% to 2.79%. Video start rate for SEM has increased every quarter since HVA targeting was implemented aside from this quarter. Video start rate from HVA targeting SEM pathways specifically also declined 20% QoQ\n",
    "- Despite the decline in video starts, SEM still drove 74% of total video starts for the quarter representing 12.1k of the 17.9k, with starts of over 30 different videos on site.\n",
    "- Despite the 7% decrease in visits QoQ from SEM, download volume increased 88% from 6.2k to 11.8k and rate increased 103% from 1.33% to 2.71%.\n",
    "- The increase in downloads was mainly driven by a 202% increase in downloads from Unbranded Condition (from 2.7k to 8.3k). Unbranded Symptoms also saw an increase in download volume by 16%.\n",
    "- With an increase in downloads, Unbranded Condition had the highest download rate of the SEM pathways during Q2 (and higher than any pathway's rate in the past year).\n",
    "- SEM drove 60% of total download volume in Q2, driving downloads of both the Patient Brochure (30%) and Newly Diagnosed Tips (27%).\n",

    "        - GRPs for this buy increased 33% QoQ, increasing the impressions for the buy, which could have attributed to the visit volume increase.\n",
    "        - Overall, Working It creative drove stronger pages per visit on site and lower bounce rate, while the In This Together creative drove more visit volume to the site with a higher average visit duration.\n",
    "    Learnings:\n",
    "        - Digital Video: The introduction of the display digital video (non-DAR) placement in Q2 quickly drove more visits, making digital video a leading traffic driver. Tagging updates in Q3 allowed for WT to distinguish the difference between the DAR and non-DAR buys, and from that point until the end of 2021, WT saw 24% of total site visits were from display digital video. However, this share declined near the end of the year, possibly due to increased competition and possibly due to wear-out, with only one creative in market since May.\n",
    "        - Additionally, 77% of visits from digital video were via desktop devices with this launch of the non-DAR buy. Visits from this buy were more engaged on the site. Desktop visitors overall were more likely to explore and engage with content on the site.\n",
    "    Actions:\n",
    "        - WT, Carat, and VMLY&R teams launched the \"In This Together\" spot alongside the currently live \"Working It\" spot as a test to understand how more than one creative performs in this new buy.\n",

However, this share declined near the end of the year, possibly due to increased competition and possibly due to wear-out, with only one creative in market since May. & WT, Carat, and VMLY&R teams launched the \"In This Together\" spot alongside the currently live \"Working It\" spot as a test to understand how more than one creative performs in this new buy. \\\\\n",

      "3. 'Webinar Driver' had a significant number of clicks (31,870) with a high media cost of $31,554.65, but it did not generate any video views. This could indicate a focus on direct engagement over video content, or it may suggest an area for improvement in multimedia integration.\n",

However, this share declined near the end of the year, possibly due to increased competition and possibly due to wear-out, with only one creative in market since May.\n",

However, this share declined near the end of the year, possibly due to increased competition and possibly due to wear-out, with only one creative in market since May.\n",

      "- Visits from reach optimized mixed placement ads decreased 31% QoQ as spend decreased and assets in market were paused as of 5/17.\n",
      "- The Doctor Discussion Guide (DDG) ad continued to drive the majority of visits from mixed placement throughout Q2 (as it has since Q4 2021) at 31k, accounting for 70% of the mixed placement visits this quarter. The First of Its Kind ad replaced the Newly Diagnosed ad in Q2 as the second largest traffic driver from the group driving 8k visits.\n",
      "- Looking Ahead: The Wunderman Thompson (WT) and Carat teams have aligned on removing Doctor Discussion Guide creative moving into Q3 to better diversify impression share across new creative and to increase visibility of different messages within the rotation.\n",

      "Twitter Reach Optimized:\n",
      "- Due to the media pause in May with spend down 53% and also a 20% increase in CPM, this campaign saw a 53% decrease in impressions QoQ.\n",
      "- There was also substantial competition in the market which led to increased CPMs the week prior to pausing which caused a decrease in impressions.\n",
      "- Performance across creatives was virtually identical.\n",
      "- A dip can be seen on 5/16 when the campaigns were paused, however, the Added Value campaign was reactivated to spend in full through the end of May\n",
      "    - Added Value was generated from Q1 investment.\n",
      "- isits from the Twitter ads were down 81% QoQ, following a 48% decline in volume from Q4 to Q1, due to a decrease in budget and an increase in CPMs. Twitter ads collectively drove 2.3k visits in Q2 and 12k in Q1, and site side engagement remained steady.\n",
      "- The Talk to Your Doctor ad continued to have the highest download rate of the Twitter ads performing well above the reach optimization average download rate at 0.32%. This was also the only ad that increased in visit volume QoQ.\n",

      "    - This is largely due to our shift to optimize to Link Clicks rather than LPV, which lowered CPC and CPM roughly 50% allowing us to be overall more efficient.\n",
      "- Static creatives continue to outperform our video ads. This is likely due to a clearer and more succinct message in the static ads compared to video, where ads are lengthier and do not feature a CTA within the first few frames.\n",
      "- Visit volume from the national traffic optimized rotation increased 14% from 149k to 170k QoQ with a slight decline in site side engagement metrics. The download rate across the buy declined due to a decrease in download volume across all ads, but especially the Patient Guides ad (-51% QoQ).\n",

However, this share declined near the end of the year, possibly due to increased competition and possibly due to wear-out, with only one creative in market since May.\n",

This creative has consistently seen a majority of campaign delivery since launch on 1/1.\\n- Visits from reach optimized mixed placement ads decreased 31% QoQ as spend decreased and assets in market were paused as of 5/17.\\n- The Doctor Discussion Guide (DDG) ad continued to drive the majority of visits from mixed placement throughout Q2 (as it has since Q4 2021) at 31k, accounting for 70% of the mixed placement visits this quarter. The First of Its Kind ad replaced the Newly Diagnosed ad in Q2 as the second largest traffic driver from the group driving 8k visits.\\n- Looking Ahead: The Wunderman Thompson (WT) and Carat teams have aligned on removing Doctor Discussion Guide creative moving into Q3 to better diversify impression share across new creative and to increase visibility of different messages within the rotation.\\n\\n- With a media pause in May, Q2 exceeded the planned benchmark by an average of 12%.\\n- Talk on Diagnosis creative continued to outperform Doctor Patient Dialogue, garnering 69% of total campaign impressions.\\n\\nTwitter Reach Optimized:\\n- Due to the media pause in May with spend down 53% and also a 20% increase in CPM, this campaign saw a 53% decrease in impressions QoQ.\\n- There was also substantial competition in the market which led to increased CPMs the week prior to pausing which caused a decrease in impressions.\\n- Performance across creatives was virtually identical.\\n- A dip can be seen on 5/16 when the campaigns were paused, however, the Added Value campaign was reactivated to spend in full through the end of May\\n    - Added Value was generated from Q1 investment.\\n- isits from the Twitter ads were down 81% QoQ, following a 48% decline in volume from Q4 to Q1, due to a decrease in budget and an increase in CPMs. Twitter ads collectively drove 2.3k visits in Q2 and 12k in Q1, and site side engagement remained steady.\\n- The Talk to Your Doctor ad continued to have the highest download rate of the Twitter ads performing well above the reach optimization average download rate at 0.32%. This was also the only ad that increased in visit volume QoQ.\\n- Twitter followers grew 21% QoQ although they increased more rapidly from Q4 to Q1. This could be due to the longevity of the page and or no new drivers to the page in Q2.\\n\\nFacebook Visits Optimized:\\n- Despite the Q2 budget cut, QoQ spend remained flat as there were budget shifts from March into Q2\\n    - Impressions increased 101% which led to an 87% increase in overall Link Clicks.\\n    - This is largely due to our shift to optimize to Link Clicks rather than LPV, which lowered CPC and CPM roughly 50% allowing us to be overall more efficient.\\n- Static creatives continue to outperform our video ads. This is likely due to a clearer and more succinct message in the static ads compared to video, where ads are lengthier and do not feature a CTA within the first few frames.\\n- Visit volume from the national traffic optimized rotation increased 14% from 149k to 170k QoQ with a slight decline in site side engagement metrics. The download rate across the buy declined due to a decrease in download volume across all ads, but especially the Patient Guides ad (-51% QoQ).\\n- Seeing a 54% visit volume increase QoQ, the Caregiver ad brought in over 75% of all visits from this buy. This ad continues to be a top performer across all traffic optimized rotations.\\n- The Trial Results ad continues to drive exceptional site side engagement both within the national buy (1.20 pages per visit, 72 second average visit duration, and 76% bounce rate) and within the local buy\\n- Looking Ahead: The national traffic optimized rotation was not planned to run in Q3.\\n', 'Zero_shot_report': \"Quarterly Performance Insights Report\\n\\n1.

This creative has consistently seen a majority of campaign delivery since launch on 1/1.\\n- Visits from reach optimized mixed placement ads decreased 31% QoQ as spend decreased and assets in market were paused as of 5/17.\\n- The Doctor Discussion Guide (DDG) ad continued to drive the majority of visits from mixed placement throughout Q2 (as it has since Q4 2021) at 31k, accounting for 70% of the mixed placement visits this quarter. The First of Its Kind ad replaced the Newly Diagnosed ad in Q2 as the second largest traffic driver from the group driving 8k visits.\\n- Looking Ahead: The Wunderman Thompson (WT) and Carat teams have aligned on removing Doctor Discussion Guide creative moving into Q3 to better diversify impression share across new creative and to increase visibility of different messages within the rotation.\\n\\n- With a media pause in May, Q2 exceeded the planned benchmark by an average of 12%.\\n- Talk on Diagnosis creative continued to outperform Doctor Patient Dialogue, garnering 69% of total campaign impressions.\\n\\nTwitter Reach Optimized:\\n- Due to the media pause in May with spend down 53% and also a 20% increase in CPM, this campaign saw a 53% decrease in impressions QoQ.\\n- There was also substantial competition in the market which led to increased CPMs the week prior to pausing which caused a decrease in impressions.\\n- Performance across creatives was virtually identical.\\n- A dip can be seen on 5/16 when the campaigns were paused, however, the Added Value campaign was reactivated to spend in full through the end of May\\n    - Added Value was generated from Q1 investment.\\n- isits from the Twitter ads were down 81% QoQ, following a 48% decline in volume from Q4 to Q1, due to a decrease in budget and an increase in CPMs. Twitter ads collectively drove 2.3k visits in Q2 and 12k in Q1, and site side engagement remained steady.\\n- The Talk to Your Doctor ad continued to have the highest download rate of the Twitter ads performing well above the reach optimization average download rate at 0.32%. This was also the only ad that increased in visit volume QoQ.\\n- Twitter followers grew 21% QoQ although they increased more rapidly from Q4 to Q1. This could be due to the longevity of the page and or no new drivers to the page in Q2.\\n\\nFacebook Visits Optimized:\\n- Despite the Q2 budget cut, QoQ spend remained flat as there were budget shifts from March into Q2\\n    - Impressions increased 101% which led to an 87% increase in overall Link Clicks.\\n    - This is largely due to our shift to optimize to Link Clicks rather than LPV, which lowered CPC and CPM roughly 50% allowing us to be overall more efficient.\\n- Static creatives continue to outperform our video ads. This is likely due to a clearer and more succinct message in the static ads compared to video, where ads are lengthier and do not feature a CTA within the first few frames.\\n- Visit volume from the national traffic optimized rotation increased 14% from 149k to 170k QoQ with a slight decline in site side engagement metrics. The download rate across the buy declined due to a decrease in download volume across all ads, but especially the Patient Guides ad (-51% QoQ).\\n- Seeing a 54% visit volume increase QoQ, the Caregiver ad brought in over 75% of all visits from this buy. This ad continues to be a top performer across all traffic optimized rotations.\\n- The Trial Results ad continues to drive exceptional site side engagement both within the national buy (1.20 pages per visit, 72 second average visit duration, and 76% bounce rate) and within the local buy\\n- Looking Ahead: The national traffic optimized rotation was not planned to run in Q3.\\n', 'Zero_shot_report': \"Quarterly Performance Insights Report\\n\\n1. Paid Social Facebook & Instagram - Reach Optimized\\n- The actualized monthly reach exceeded the planned target by 6%, achieving 36% against a planned 30%.\\n- The reach peaked in April with 37% before slightly declining to 35% in May, with no data available for June.\\n- The 'Doctor Discussion Guide' campaign dominated the quarterly impressions with 56%, followed by 'First of Its Kind - 2021' at 18%.\\n- The highest number of daily visits for 'Doctor Discussion Guide' was on April 15th with 927 visits, indicating a strong performance mid-quarter.\\n- There was a noticeable drop in daily visits for all campaigns after May 13th, with no visits recorded from May 20th onwards, suggesting a potential issue with campaign delivery or tracking.\\n\\n2. Paid Social Twitter - Reach Optimized\\n- The actualized monthly reach was slightly above the planned target at 31%.\\n- There was a significant drop in reach from April's 38% to May's 24%, indicating a potential issue or change in strategy.\\n- 'Ambassador in the Moment 2022' and 'Talk to Your Doctor - 3.2.22' both had the highest share of impressions at 21% each for Q2.\\n- Twitter ad visits showed growth from Q1 to Q2 for 'Talk to Your Doctor', but a decrease for '#1 Prescribed' and 'Living in the Moment'.\\n- Twitter page metrics revealed a decline in profile visits, mentions, and impressions from Q1 to Q2, but an increase in followers by 20%.\\n\\n3. Paid Social Facebook - Visit Optimized\\n- The CPC in Q2-22 was significantly lower at $1.04 compared to the previous quarters, with Q4-21 being the highest at $2.53.\\n- Clicks in Q2-22 saw a substantial increase to 418,040 from 223,494 in Q1-22, indicating improved campaign effectiveness.\\n- 'Caregiver Support Version A' had the highest number of clicks at 312,363 with a CPC of $1.00, which is below the benchmark of $1.83.\\n- National visit optimized metrics showed an increase in visits by 14% QoQ, but a decrease in pages per visit and average visit duration, suggesting lower engagement.\\n- The download rate decreased by 29% from Q1 to Q2, which could indicate a need for review of content or user experience.\\n\\nSpanish Campaigns:\\n- The actualized monthly reach for Spanish campaigns was significantly higher than planned at 42%.\\n- 'Talk on Diagnosis Spanish' had a dominant share of impressions at 69%, showing the effectiveness of this ad in reaching the target audience.\\n- The impressions for 'Doctor patient dialogue spanish' and 'Talk on diagnosis spanish' showed fluctuations, with the highest impressions recorded in the first week of April.\\n\\nOverall, the data indicates a strong performance in reach for Facebook & Instagram and Spanish campaigns, while Twitter showed mixed results. The Facebook visit optimized campaign demonstrated cost efficiency but may need to address engagement issues.
